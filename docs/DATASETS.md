| Dataset | Type / size | Labels | License | Use here |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Cambridge SyntheticGauges](http://www.jjcvision.com/projects/gauge_reading.html) (Howells et al., CVPRW 2021) | synthetic, 11,000 imgs, 1024 px | COCO box + center/tip/min/max + face corners | CC BY-NC 4.0 | baseline synthetic set to compare against ours |
| [Cambridge RealGauges](http://www.jjcvision.com/projects/gauge_reading.html) | real, 6 gauges: detection, pose, 2,700 reading frames | center, plane normal, angle, value | CC BY-NC 4.0 | **main real-world test set** |
| [Roboflow: hustlegrad/analog-gauge-reading](https://universe.roboflow.com/hustlegrad/analog-gauge-reading-v4tii) (export source: `hustlegrad/gauge-detection-2-2ynzm` v7) | real web images, 326 originals (train 245 / valid 49 / test 32; train tripled by brightness aug to 735) | YOLOv8-pose, `kpt_shape [2,3]`, classes Gauge / Max / Min / Needle. Needle: pt1 = pivot, pt2 = tip. Min, Max: pt1 = tick position. Gauge: box only | CC BY 4.0 | keypoint and needle-fraction evaluation only (no min/max numbers, no reading GT, so no % FS error) |
| [Roboflow: analog-6kh04/analog-gauge](https://universe.roboflow.com/analog-6kh04/analog-gauge-obaw9) | real, 1,471, no augmentation, train split only | YOLOv8 segmentation polygons: center / meter / needle / scale | CC BY 4.0 | detection and needle segmentation evaluation; we create our own val/test split. No reading GT |
| [Synanthropic/reading-analog-gauge](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Synanthropic/reading-analog-gauge) | 42,442 imgs, 2.6 GB | dial corners, keypoints | MIT | auxiliary training, freely redistributable |
| [RPM-10K](https://github.com/Event-AHU/DialBench) (Wang et al., 2025) | real, 10,730, 300+ dial types | text reading only | dataset TBD (code BSD-3) | not used until a license is published |

Caveats
- hustlegrad images were exported with a 640x640 stretch resize, and the export does not keep the original image sizes, so the stretch cannot be undone exactly. Estimate it per image from the Gauge box aspect ratio (dials are circular, assuming a roughly frontal view) and rescale x or y to make the box square before measuring angles. Report needle-fraction metrics alongside, and note the residual distortion for oblique views.
- For evaluation, dedupe train to its 245 originals (group files by the name prefix before `.rf.`) and keep valid (49) and test (32), which are not augmented. The evaluation set is the 326 originals.
- Neither Roboflow set has a reading ground truth. % of full scale error is measured on Cambridge RealGauges and on our own photos.

Rules
- CC BY 4.0 data (Roboflow) requires attribution: cite the dataset URL and author in results and the README.
- CC BY-NC data is used for evaluation and research only; raw images are never re-uploaded.
- Demo examples (Hugging Face Space, README GIFs) use only our own photos and our own synthetic renders.
- Cite every dataset used in results tables.
